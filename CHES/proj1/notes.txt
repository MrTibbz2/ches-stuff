DELIVERY SERVICE MANAGER

gonna be for delivering coffee beans because.. yum

feature plan:
- add time, date, deliveryperson, address, orderitems (list), order total: to a queue of deliveries to be done
- add a menu integration to control orders from users and add totals based on orders, assign deliveryperson to orders based on time
- add sql to make things consistent through runs of the program 
- maybe a ui?

roadmap:
1. data movement class, basic cli
2. menu to calculate order totals
3. sql databases

main queue functions needed:
- Append: add items to the end of the delivery queue to be delivered later on, queued up to be delivered
- pop: remove the delivery after it has been delivered
- peek: view the upcoming delivery
- size(): view the number of deliveries pending
- clear(): error handeling and system reset
- peek_last(): show the latest placed delivery
- is_empty(): error handling
